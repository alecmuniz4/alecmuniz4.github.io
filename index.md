### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

   In Lab 5, part 1 was my favorite because it was a fun challenge to work with. It was my first time using vectors, and it was cool to apply what I learned in lectures in the lab. Using inputs to create a sandwich was a good learning experience for me. 

* Lab 7

    In Lab 7, part 1 was also my favorite because it involved calculating numbers. In the program, we had the Julian date equation and used date inputs to store the regular dates to calculate the date difference between two dates. It was both complex and straightforward but using math in coding is fun.

* Lab 8

    In Lab 8, part 2 was also my favorite because it was a learning process for me to understand. I was still learning about files, and this part was a simple yet challenging assignment. After my partner assisted me with the topic of files, I understood what to code and their purpose.
